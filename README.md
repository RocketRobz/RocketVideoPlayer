- Both 8 BPP (256 colors) and 16 BPP (RGB555/RGB565) videos are supported.
    - Your video's height must be 108px or less in order to use 16 BPP.
    - Screen filters are not supported for 16 BPP videos.
- Support for dual-screen videos (up to 30FPS)!
- Support for audio up to 32khz Mono.
- The video UI from the "Nintendo DSi + Internet" app, with the title bar now containing the console's set color.
- Console-based file browser to search for your `.rvid` file.
